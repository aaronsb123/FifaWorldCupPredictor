# FifaWorldCupPredictor
## iX Hackathon Project June 2018
With the 2018 Fifa World Cup going on, the team decided to design a match predictor for a specific bracket. For starters we will take the Qualifying 32 in the bracket and improve it to unclude randoms teams.

Our basic dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017/data)
and we have scraped extra information such as population and tv_audience share and therby popularity of the sport in the countries

We will atempt to do *Supervised Machine Learning* on all data till 2014 and train it to the results of the 2014 World Cup. And use the 2018 bracket as our testing set.
